        <h2>How do I open the Kwery AI chat window?</h2>
        <p>There are four different ways to open the Kwery AI chat window.</p>
        <p>
            The simplest is to click the Kwery AI extension icon (the robot
            shown above). To see the extension icon, you first have to click the
            “Extensions” button in the top right of your browser window, which
            should be shown in the form of a puzzle icon. While you’re there,
            you might want to pin the extension for easy access.
        </p>

        <p>The other ways are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Right click on almost any page, and click “Open Kwery AI”</li>
            <li>Use the shortcut, which is ctrl + q or cmd + q by default</li>
            <li>
                Start typing “Kwery” in the address bar (omnibox) at the top of
                your browser window, and you should see “Open Kwery AI” as an
                option
            </li>
        </ul>
